# Ground Branch Server Manager
---
GB Server Manager was is a WPF desktop app published under the GNU Public License intended as a replacement for the script that currently runs and manages ground branch servers running on Windows server.

It currently has the ability to import and manage servers that already exist, Monitoring and re-starting the server after time out.  

### In Development
- Ability to edit ini files
- Ability to download and create servers right from the app
- Maybe RCON support for managing the server from the app (if implemented by the devs)
