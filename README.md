It currently has the ability to import and manage servers that already exist, Monitoring and re-starting the server after time out. As this is in active development, there may be some bugs or eccentricites that need resolved.  Please feel free to reach out or open an issue if you encounter one.

### In Development
- Ability to edit ini files
- Ability to download and create servers right from the app
- Maybe RCON support for managing the server from the app (if implemented by the devs)
